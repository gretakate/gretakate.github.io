                <h3><strong>Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab</strong>, Asymmetric Operations Sector</h3>
                <p><strong>Data Scientist and Software Developer </strong> | October 2020 - Present | Laurel, MD</p>
                <p>Some highlights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Designed and implemented a locally hosted chatbot giving sponsors access to LLMs on data-sensitive missions. Evaluated and selected open-source LLMs and deployed locally with NVIDIA TensorRT. Built out the prompt construction, memory management, and post-processing workflows.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Developed a tissue classifier model to identify tissues from unknown mixed samples using an ensemble of One vs Rest and strategically selected One vs One random forests to enable multilabel classification across highly similar and imbalanced classes. Improved generalization and enabled more rigorous validation of model to varied collection procedures, sequencing technologies, and chemistries by identifying and incorporating publicly available genomic datasets.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Led team of 6, responsible for daily delivery of the County Cases and Death data posted directly to the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) official Covid Data Tracker, used by policymakers and healthcare officials nationwide to inform critical decisions. Designed and implemented an automated COVID-19 time series data delivery pipeline, resulting in an 85% reduction in delivery time. Supported frequent meetings with state health departments to coordinate collection processes on behalf of the CDC. Guided CDC in their transition to weekly COVID data reporting by presenting detailed analyses of decision trade-offs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Ensured data fidelity and real-time availability for the widely recognized Johns Hopkins COVID Dashboard, working 3-4 on-call shifts biweekly over the course of two years to update web scrapers as their sources were updated. Project was awarded TIME Best Invention of 2020: 2020’s Go-To Data Source; Team recognized by Fast Company as 2021’s Innovative Team of the Year.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Designed and led an interactive workshop on LangChain as part of a Generative AI Workshop Series, giving an audience of 150+ people hands-on experience in working with LangChain to integrate LLMs into their applications. Documentation and code were circulated widely across the laboratory and have been used as a reference for many getting started with LLMs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Led company-wide innovation challenge program focused on developing early-career staff members. Developed the 2023 challenge topic and planned a 6 month program involving 10+ staff development  events for 50 participants from across all sectors of the lab. Efficiently managed a $950k program budget. Mentored two team leads one-on-one.</p>

                <h3>Deconvoluting Mixed Virus RNA Sequences with Graph Attention Networks (GATs)</h3>
                <p>Designed a novel method for separating read fragments from a mixture of SARS-COV-2 virus sequences to enable early detection of emerging strains. Trained a GAT to create embedding vectors from a graph of reads from unknown sources, optimized to cluster reads by original source sequence. Achieved an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.86 on test mixtures, indicating strong consistency between clusters produced and original sources.</p>
