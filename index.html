            <div class="about-details">
                <p>I am a passionate data scientist and engineer with five years of work experience. I’ve been fortunate enough to work on projects that span a variety of disciplines and tap into what I loved most from my studies in Data Science, Electrical Engineering, and Applied Mathematics: finding patterns, analyzing signals, and implementing solutions.</p> 
                <br/>
                <p>I have a strong programming background and am comfortable with the full stack of development. Coworkers have described me as the ‘Swiss Army knife’ of the team because of my ability to quickly pick up new technical skills and contribute to where I’m needed most- whether that’s developing new algorithms, training models, setting up data pipelines, picking up frontend or backend development tasks, designing software and leading a technical team, or even sometimes waking up at 5 a.m. to email the official daily COVID death count to the Director of the CDC.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>One of my biggest strengths is immersing myself so deeply in a dataset or field that I become a go-to resource on my teams to explain data anomalies and model behavior. I get most excited when I’m able to come up with a new idea for an algorithm based on my knowledge of how the data is generated. Recently, I’ve most enjoyed exploring the intersection of machine learning and bioinformatics.
